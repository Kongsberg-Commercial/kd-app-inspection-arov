This folder contains numerous utility scripts that have been used for the bachelor project. The list below gives some brief explainations for what the purposes of the scripts are:

- calculate_covmatrix.py: Parses positioning data from a log-file to find the covariance-matrix and uncertainty radius
- receive_processedvideo.py: Can be run on topside computer to receive the processed video-stream during pipe-following missions
- test_imageprocessing_steps.py: Shows the image after each major processing step. Takes input image as argv1 or defaults to test.png
